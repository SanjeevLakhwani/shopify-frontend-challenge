# NASAlib (Shopify frontend challenge)
An SPA that uses [Nasa Image and Video Library API](https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf) to browse some of the best images in existence. This was made for [Shopify Frontend Developer Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13zXpyrC2yGxoLXKktxw2VJG2Jw8SdUfliLM-bYQLjqE/edit#) by [@Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjeevlakhwani/). Hope I get in <3, ðŸ¤ž. 

Fun fact, it (or me) does not forget what you like (it is persisted).

Given the time Constraints of being a student, the website was not built with a design in perspective. If in a metaverse I was to be Dr. Strange, I would have predesigned it and then made my life easier.
